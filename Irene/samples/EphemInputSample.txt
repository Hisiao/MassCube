# Sample CmdLineIrene application input file for the generation of ephemeris *only*.
# Any lines starting with a '#' are considered comments, and therefore ignored. 
# 
# Input parameters for the CmdLineIrene application in this file are expected
# to be in a "Keyword: Value(s)" form.  Many different parameters are available
# to define the desired orbital path, the ephemeris propagator to be used, and 
# the start/stop time and increment size.  Other parameters are used to specify
# the output time forms, coordinate system, units and ordering, and file's data 
# delimiter.
# The available keywords and their associated values are fully described in the
#  "IRENE: AE9/AP9/SPM Radiation Environment Model User's Guide" document.
#
# All file specifications may use either 'absolute' paths, or 'relative' paths
# (in reference to the directory from which the CmdLineIrene application is run).
# This sample input file uses 'relative' paths, which assumes that the application
# is to be run from its installation directory location.
# Alternatively, environment variables may be used in the file specifications;
#  ie '$IRENE_DATA/igrfDB.h5'.

#  Note that for subsequent use of this ephemeris file for model calculations,
#  the time/coord/delim forms would need to be specified in order for the
#  contents of the file to be properly read.  Use the same parameter keywords,
#  except prepended with 'In' (ie 'CoordUnits: km' ==> 'InCoordUnits: km')
#
#
# Alternatively, the ephemeris information may be generated using a TLE file
#  (the ephemeris is written to the file specified by 'OrbitFile')
