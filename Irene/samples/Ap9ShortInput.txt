# Sample CmdLineIrene application input file for the AE-9 or AP-9 model runs. 
# Any lines starting with a '#' are considered comments, and therefore ignored. 
# 
# Input parameters for the CmdLineIrene application in this file are expected
# to be in a "Keyword: Value(s)" form.  Many different parameters are available
# to define the flux model, its associated calculation options, energy levels
# and generated output values.  Additional parameters are used to describe the
# ephemeris or grid coordinates for the flux calculations, as well as subsequent
# calculations to perform, such as radiation dosage behind shielding.
# The available keywords and their associated values are fully described in the
#  "IRENE: AE9/AP9/SPM Radiation Environment Model User's Guide" document.
#
# All file specifications may use either 'absolute' paths, or 'relative' paths
# (in reference to the directory from which the CmdLineIrene application is run).
# This sample input file uses 'relative' paths, which assumes that the application
# is to be run from its installation directory location.
# Alternatively, environment variables may be used in the file specifications;
#  ie '$IRENE_DATA/igrfDB.h5'.

# -------------------------------------
# Short test run for AP-9 model input parameters, generating orbit file:
#
# specify model type and corresponding database file
ModelType:   AP9
ModelDB:     ../../modelData/AP9V15_runtime_tables.mat
#   for electrons (AE9), specify this model database file:
###ModelDB:     ../../modelData/AE9V15_runtime_tables.mat
#
# define the file 'prefix' for all generated model output files
OutFile:     ../../samples/Ap9ShortOutput.txt
#
# specify the supporting model database files for magfield and model coordinates
MagfieldDB:  ../../modelData/igrfDB.h5
KPhiDB:  ../../modelData/fastPhi_net.mat
KHminDB: ../../modelData/fast_hmin_net.mat
#
#  specify flux type and list of energy levels appropriate for particle species
FluxType:    1PtDiff
Energies:    1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 35.0, 60.0, 100.0, 150.0
#  valid energy range for protons:   0.10 - 2000 MeV
#  valid energy range for electrons: 0.04 - 10.0 MeV
#
# specify the flux calculation modes and additional calculation outputs
FluxOut:       mean
FluxOut:       percentile,50,75,95
#
# generate the ephemeris using mean elements; those not specified use default = 0.0
#  (the ephemeris is written to the file specified in 'OrbitFile')
